# CRF-Japanese-Accent / Tokyo Accent Sandhi Estimation Toolkit: TASET

Mirror of https://sites.google.com/site/suzukimasayuki/accent

This is the implementation of the conditional-random field model for pitch accent estimation described in the paper "Accent Sandhi Estimation of Tokyo Dialect of Japanese Using
Conditional Random Fields". It also appears to be the model used (might still also be) for the well-known Prosody-Teacher Suzuki-kun service.

Note: am unrelated to the authors, just mirroring in Github.
